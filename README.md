# FCT_Analysis
This repository contains all the analysis codes I have used for the analysis of the FCT. 

Each directory in this repository contains code for an analysis I have done. README.md files are added to tell you what every analysis does. Some general explanation is given, but most of it is specific only for the analyssi of the FCT. This is therefore only a guide how to use the programs and not something that is intended to teach you how to use individual components of the analysis programs (like explaining what a TTree is). However, whne I feel some explanation is necessary, this will be given.
